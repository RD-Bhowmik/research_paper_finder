    "summary": "  Cervical cancer is a prevalent disease affecting millions of women worldwide\nevery year. It requires significant attention, as early detection during the\nprecancerous stage provides an opportunity for a cure. The screening and\ndiagnosis of cervical cancer rely on cytology and colposcopy methods. Deep\nlearning, a promising technology in computer vision, has emerged as a potential\nsolution to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cervical cancer screening\ncompared to traditional clinical inspection methods that are prone to human\nerror. This review article discusses cervical cancer and its screening\nprocesses, followed by the Deep Learning training process and the\nclassification, segmentation, and detection tasks for cervical cancer\ndiagnosis. Additionally, we explored the most common public datasets used in\nboth cytology and colposcopy and highlighted the popular and most utilized\narchitectures that researchers have applied to both cytology and colposcopy. We\nreviewed 24 selected practical papers in this study and summarized them. This\narticle highlights the remarkable efficiency in enhancing the precision and\nspeed of cervical cancer analysis by Deep Learning, bringing us closer to early\ndiagnosis and saving lives.\n",

This study aims to report the overall survival rates and\nassociated factors of patients diagnosed with malignant cervical cancer in\nBrunei Darussalam. Methods: A retrospective study of patients diagnosed with\ncervical cancer from 2007 to 2017 in Brunei Darussalam. The data were obtained\nfrom the population-based cancer registry in Brunei Darussalam. Kaplan- Meier\nsurvival analysis was used to estimate the overall survival rates at 1-, 3- and\n5-year intervals while the log-rank test was used to assess differences in\nsurvival between groups. Cox Proportional Hazard (PH) regression analysis was\nused to examine the association of demographic and clinical factors on the\nsurvival of cervical cancer patients. Results: A total of 329 registered\nmalignant cervical cancer cases were analyzed. The mean age at diagnosis of\npatients with cervical cancer was 46.7 years. There were 28.6% deaths and the\noverall survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 85.4%, 72.6% and 68.6%\nrespectively. Age at diagnosis, cancer stage and histology types were\nsignificant predictive factors for overall survival of the patients diagnosed\nwith cervical cancers when analysed on both log rank tests and Cox PH model.\nConclusion: Age at diagnosis, cancer stage and histology types were\nsignificantly associated with the overall survival rates of cervical cancer\npatients in Brunei Darussalam. Early detection and management of cervical\ncancer at early stages should be prioritized to improve the survival rate and\nquality of cancer care.\n",

    "summary": "  Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a significant public health concern, as it is a\nleading cause of cervical cancer in women. However, data on the prevalence of\nHPV infection among Iraqi women is scarce. This study aimed to estimate the\nprevalence of HPV infection and its associated factors among Iraqi women aged\n15-50 attending health centers. In this cross-sectional study, 362 female\nparticipants aged 15-50 were recruited from health centers in Iraq. Serological\ntests were used to screen for HPV infection. Sociodemographic information,\nobstetric history, and contraceptive use were collected. Pap smears were\nperformed to assess cervical changes related to HPV infection. Of the 362\nparticipants, 65 (17.96%) tested positive for HPV. The majority of HPV-positive\nwomen were aged 30-35 years, housewives, and belonged to lower social classes.\nAmong HPV-positive women, 30% had abnormal Pap smears, with 55% diagnosed with\ncervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN1), 25% with CIN2, and 15% with\nCIN3. Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis in 5% of cases. No significant association\nwas found between HPV infection and contraceptive use. Most HPV-positive women\nwere multiparous. This study reveals a considerable prevalence of HPV infection\namong Iraqi women attending health centers, particularly in the age group of\n30-35 years and among housewives. These findings highlight the need for\ntargeted public health interventions to increase HPV awareness, promote regular\nscreening, and improve access to healthcare services for women, especially\nthose from lower social classes. Further research is warranted to better\nunderstand the factors contributing to HPV transmission in Iraq and to develop\neffective prevention strategies.\n",

While Pap smear screening is a prevalent diagnostic method,\nvisual image analysis can be lengthy and often leads to mistakes. Early\ndetection of the disease can contribute significantly to improving patient\noutcomes. In recent decades, many researchers have employed machine learning\ntechniques that achieved promise in cervical cancer detection processes based\non medical images. In recent years, many researchers have employed various\ndeep-learning techniques to achieve high-performance accuracy in detecting\ncervical cancer but are still facing various challenges. This research proposes\nan innovative and novel approach to automate cervical cancer image\nclassification using Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) and convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs). The proposed method leverages the strengths of both MHSA\nmechanisms and CNN to effectively capture both local and global features within\ncervical images in two streams. MHSA facilitates the model's ability to focus\non relevant regions of interest, while CNN extracts hierarchical features that\ncontribute to accurate classification. Finally, we combined the two stream\nfeatures and fed them into the classification module to refine the feature and\nthe classification. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we\nused the SIPaKMeD dataset, which classifies cervical cells into five\ncategories. Our model achieved a remarkable accuracy of 98.522\\%. This\nperformance has high recognition accuracy of medical image classification and\nholds promise for its applicability in other medical image recognition tasks.\n",

The transformation zone in\nthe cervix, where cellular differentiation occurs, plays a critical role in the\ndetection of abnormalities. Colposcopy has emerged as a pivotal tool in\ncervical cancer prevention since it provides a meticulous examination of\ncervical abnormalities. However, challenges in visual evaluation necessitate\nthe development of Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems.\n  We propose a novel CAD system that combines the strengths of various\ndeep-learning descriptors (ResNet50, ResNet101, and ResNet152) with appropriate\nfeature normalization (min-max) as well as feature reduction technique (LDA).\nThe combination of different descriptors ensures that all the features\n(low-level like edges and colour, high-level like shape and texture) are\ncaptured, feature normalization prevents biased learning, and feature reduction\navoids overfitting. We do experiments on the IARC dataset provided by WHO. The\ndataset is initially segmented and balanced. Our approach achieves exceptional\nperformance in the range of 97%-100% for both the normal-abnormal and the type\nclassification.

To address this issue, we introduced Smart-CCS, a generalizable\nCervical Cancer Screening paradigm based on pretraining and adaptation to\ncreate robust and generalizable screening systems. To develop and validate\nSmart-CCS, we first curated a large-scale, multi-center dataset named CCS-127K,\nwhich comprises a total of 127,471 cervical cytology whole-slide images\ncollected from 48 medical centers. By leveraging large-scale self-supervised\npretraining, our CCS models are equipped with strong generalization capability,\npotentially generalizing across diverse scenarios. Then, we incorporated\ntest-time adaptation to specifically optimize the trained CCS model for complex\nclinical settings, which adapts and refines predictions, improving real-world\napplicability. We conducted large-scale system evaluation among various\ncohorts. In retrospective cohorts, Smart-CCS achieved an overall area under the\ncurve (AUC) value of 0.965 and sensitivity of 0.913 for cancer screening on 11\ninternal test datasets. In external testing, system performance maintained high\nat 0.950 AUC across 6 independent test datasets.

    "summary": "  Cervical cancer, one of the most common fatal cancers among women, can be\nprevented by regular screening to detect any precancerous lesions at early\nstages and treat them. Pap smear test is a widely performed screening technique\nfor early detection of cervical cancer, whereas this manual screening method\nsuffers from high false-positive results because of human errors. To improve\nthe manual screening practice, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)\nbased computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems have been investigated widely to\nclassify cervical pap cells. Most of the existing researches require\npre-segmented images to obtain good classification results, whereas accurate\ncervical cell segmentation is challenging because of cell clustering. Some\nstudies rely on handcrafted features, which cannot guarantee the classification\nstage's optimality. Moreover, DL provides poor performance for a multiclass\nclassification task when there is an uneven distribution of data, which is\nprevalent in the cervical cell dataset. This investigation has addressed those\nlimitations by proposing DeepCervix, a hybrid deep feature fusion (HDFF)\ntechnique based on DL to classify the cervical cells accurately. Our proposed\nmethod uses various DL models to capture more potential information to enhance\nclassification performance. Our proposed HDFF method is tested on the publicly\navailable SIPAKMED dataset and compared the performance with base DL models and\nthe LF method. For the SIPAKMED dataset, we have obtained the state-of-the-art\nclassification accuracy of 99.85%, 99.38%, and 99.14% for 2-class, 3-class, and\n5-class classification.

Pap\nsmear images are one of the most constructive ways for identifying this type of\ncancer. This study proposes a cross-attention-based Transfomer approach for the\nreliable classification of cervical cancer in Pap smear images. Methods: In\nthis study, we propose the CerviFormer -- a model that depends on the\nTransformers and thereby requires minimal architectural assumptions about the\nsize of the input data. The model uses a cross-attention technique to\nrepeatedly consolidate the input data into a compact latent Transformer module,\nwhich enables it to manage very large-scale inputs. We evaluated our model on\ntwo publicly available Pap smear datasets. Results: For 3-state classification\non the Sipakmed data, the model achieved an accuracy of 93.70%. For 2-state\nclassification on the Herlev data, the model achieved an accuracy of 94.57%.\nConclusion: Experimental results on two publicly accessible datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive results when compared\nto contemporary approaches. The proposed method brings forth a comprehensive\nclassification model to detect cervical cancer in Pap smear images. This may\naid medical professionals in providing better cervical cancer treatment,\nconsequently, enhancing the overall effectiveness of the entire testing\nprocess.\n",

    "summary": "  Cervical Cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer in women worldwide.\nMost cases of cervical cancer can be prevented through screening programs aimed\nat detecting precancerous lesions. During Digital Colposcopy, Specular\nReflections (SR) appear as bright spots heavily saturated with white light.\nThese occur due to the presence of moisture on the uneven cervix surface, which\nact like mirrors reflecting light from the illumination source. Apart from\ncamouflaging the actual features, the SR also affects subsequent segmentation\nroutines and hence must be removed. Our novel technique eliminates the SR and\nmakes the colposcopic images (cervigram) ready for segmentation algorithms. The\ncervix region occupies about half of the cervigram image. Other parts of the\nimage contain irrelevant information, such as equipment, frames, text and\nnon-cervix tissues. This irrelevant information can confuse automatic\nidentification of the tissues within the cervix. The first step is, therefore,\nfocusing on the cervical borders, so that we have a geometric boundary on the\nrelevant image area. We have proposed a type of modified kmeans clustering\nalgorithm to evaluate the region of interest.\n",

    "summary": "  While most previous automation-assisted reading methods can improve\nefficiency, their performance often relies on the success of accurate cell\nsegmentation and hand-craft feature extraction. This paper presents an\nefficient and totally segmentation-free method for automated cervical cell\nscreening that utilizes modern object detector to directly detect cervical\ncells or clumps, without the design of specific hand-crafted feature.\nSpecifically, we use the state-of-the-art CNN-based object detection methods,\nYOLOv3, as our baseline model. In order to improve the classification\nperformance of hard examples which are four highly similar categories, we\ncascade an additional task-specific classifier. We also investigate the\npresence of unreliable annotations and cope with them by smoothing the\ndistribution of noisy labels. We comprehensively evaluate our methods on test\nset which is consisted of 1,014 annotated cervical cell images with size of\n4000*3000 and complex cellular situation corresponding to 10 categories. Our\nmodel achieves 97.5% sensitivity (Sens) and 67.8% specificity (Spec) on\ncervical cell image-level screening. Moreover, we obtain a mean Average\nPrecision (mAP) of 63.4% on cervical cell-level diagnosis, and improve the\nAverage Precision (AP) of hard examples which are valuable but difficult to\ndistinguish. Our automation-assisted cervical cell reading method not only\nachieves cervical cell image-level classification but also provides more\ndetailed location and category information of abnormal cells. The results\nindicate feasible performance of our method, together with the efficiency and\nrobustness, providing a new idea for future development of computer-assisted\nreading system in clinical cervical screening.\n",

    "summary": "  Automatic thin-prep cytologic test (TCT) screening can assist pathologists in\nfinding cervical abnormality towards accurate and efficient cervical cancer\ndiagnosis. Current automatic TCT screening systems mostly involve abnormal\ncervical cell detection, which generally requires large-scale and diverse\ntraining data with high-quality annotations to achieve promising performance.\nPathological image synthesis is naturally raised to minimize the efforts in\ndata collection and annotation. However, it is challenging to generate\nrealistic large-size cytopathological images while simultaneously synthesizing\nvisually plausible appearances for small-size abnormal cervical cells. In this\npaper, we propose a two-stage image synthesis framework to create synthetic\ndata for augmenting cervical abnormality screening. In the first Global Image\nGeneration stage, a Normal Image Generator is designed to generate\ncytopathological images full of normal cervical cells. In the second Local Cell\nEditing stage, normal cells are randomly selected from the generated images and\nthen are converted to different types of abnormal cells using the proposed\nAbnormal Cell Synthesizer. Both Normal Image Generator and Abnormal Cell\nSynthesizer are built upon Stable Diffusion, a pre-trained foundation model for\nimage synthesis, via parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for customizing\ncytopathological image contents and extending spatial layout controllability,\nrespectively. Our experiments demonstrate the synthetic image quality,\ndiversity, and controllability of the proposed synthesis framework, and\nvalidate its data augmentation effectiveness in enhancing the performance of\nabnormal cervical cell detection.\n",

This paper presents the Cervix-AID-Net model for\ncervical precancer risk classification. The study designs and evaluates the\nproposed Cervix-AID-Net model based on patients colposcopy images. The model\ncomprises a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and convolutional\nlayers that extract interpretable and representative features of colposcopic\nimages to distinguish high-risk and low-risk cervical precancer. In addition,\nthe proposed Cervix-AID-Net model integrates four explainable techniques,\nnamely gradient class activation maps, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic\nExplanations, CartoonX, and pixel rate distortion explanation based on output\nfeature maps and input features. The evaluation using holdout and ten-fold\ncross-validation techniques yielded a classification accuracy of 99.33\\% and\n99.81\\%. The analysis revealed that CartoonX provides meticulous explanations\nfor the decision of the Cervix-AID-Net model due to its ability to provide the\nrelevant piece-wise smooth part of the image. The effect of Gaussian noise and\nblur on the input shows that the performance remains unchanged up to Gaussian\nnoise of 3\\% and blur of 10\\%, while the performance reduces thereafter. A\ncomparison study of the proposed model's performance compared to other deep\nlearning approaches highlights the Cervix-AID-Net model's potential as a\nsupplemental tool for increasing the effectiveness of cervical precancer risk\nassessment. The proposed method, which incorporates the CBAM and explainable\nartificial integration, has the potential to influence cervical cancer\nprevention and early detection, improving patient outcomes and lowering the\nworldwide burden of this preventable disease.\n",

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) emerged as a\nnon-invasive, high-resolution imaging technology for cervical disease\ndetection. However, OCT image annotation is knowledge-intensive and\ntime-consuming, which impedes the training process of deep-learning-based\nclassification models. Purpose: This study aims to develop a computer-aided\ndiagnosis (CADx) approach to classifying in-vivo cervical OCT images based on\nself-supervised learning. Methods: In addition to high-level semantic features\nextracted by a convolutional neural network (CNN), the proposed CADx approach\nleverages unlabeled cervical OCT images' texture features learned by\ncontrastive texture learning. We conducted ten-fold cross-validation on the OCT\nimage dataset from a multi-center clinical study on 733 patients from China.\nResults: In a binary classification task for detecting high-risk diseases,\nincluding high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and cervical cancer, our\nmethod achieved an area-under-the-curve value of 0.9798 plus or minus 0.0157\nwith a sensitivity of 91.17 plus or minus 4.99% and a specificity of 93.96 plus\nor minus 4.72% for OCT image patches; also, it outperformed two out of four\nmedical experts on the test set.

Conclusions: The proposed\ncontrastive-learning-based CADx method outperformed the end-to-end CNN models\nand provided better interpretability based on texture features, which holds\ngreat potential to be used in the clinical protocol of \"see-and-treat.\"\n",

    "summary": "  The cervix is the narrow end of the uterus that connects to the vagina in the\nfemale reproductive system. Abnormal cell growth in the squamous epithelial\nlining of the cervix leads to cervical cancer in females. A Pap smear is a\ndiagnostic procedure used to detect cervical cancer by gently collecting cells\nfrom the surface of the cervix with a small brush and analyzing their changes\nunder a microscope. For population-based cervical cancer screening, visual\ninspection with acetic acid is a cost-effective method with high sensitivity.\nHowever, Pap smears are also suitable for mass screening due to their higher\nspecificity. The current Pap smear analysis method is manual, time-consuming,\nlabor-intensive, and prone to human error. Therefore, an artificial\nintelligence (AI)-based approach for automatic cell classification is needed.\nIn this study, we aimed to classify cells in Pap smear images into five\ncategories: superficial-intermediate, parabasal, koilocytes, dyskeratotic, and\nmetaplastic. Various machine learning (ML) algorithms, including Gradient\nBoosting, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and k-Nearest Neighbor, as\nwell as deep learning (DL) approaches like ResNet-50, were employed for this\nclassification task. The ML models demonstrated high classification accuracy;\nhowever, ResNet-50 outperformed the others, achieving a classification accuracy\nof 93.06%. This study highlights the efficiency of DL models for cell-level\nclassification and their potential to aid in the early diagnosis of cervical\ncancer from Pap smear images.\n",

Cervical cancer incidence has significantly\ndecreased in countries that developed systems for organized screening engaging\nmedical practitioners, laboratories and patients. The system automatically\nidentifies individuals at risk of developing the disease and invites them for a\nscreening exam or a follow-up exam conducted by medical professionals. A triage\nalgorithm in the system aims to reduce unnecessary screening exams for\nindividuals at low-risk while detecting and treating individuals at high-risk.\nDespite the general success of screening, the triage algorithm is a\none-size-fits all approach that is not personalized to a patient. This can\neasily be observed in historical data from screening exams. Often patients rely\non personal factors to determine that they are either at high risk or not at\nrisk at all and take action at their own discretion. Can exploring patient\ntrajectories help hypothesize personal factors leading to their decisions? We\npresent Portinari, a data exploration tool to query and visualize future\ntrajectories of patients who have undergone a specific sequence of screening\nexams. The web-based tool contains (a) a visual query interface (b) a backend\ngraph database of events in patients' lives (c) trajectory visualization using\nsankey diagrams. We use Portinari to explore diverse trajectories of patients\nfollowing the Norwegian triage algorithm. The trajectories demonstrated\nvariable degrees of adherence to the triage algorithm and allowed\nepidemiologists to hypothesize about the possible causes.\n",

CIN are classified\ninto three grades of increasing severity (CIN-1, CIN-2, and CIN-3) and can\neventually develop into cervical cancer. The main purpose of screening is\ndetecting CIN-2 and CIN-3 cases which are usually surgically removed. Screening\ndata from the POBASCAM trial involving 1,454 HPV-positive women is analyzed\nwith two objectives: estimate (a) the transition time from HPV diagnosis to\nCIN-3; and (b) the transition time from CIN-2 to CIN-3.

Second, a woman's progression to\nCIN-3 is only observed, if the woman progresses to, both, CIN-2 and from CIN-2\nto CIN-3 in the same screening interval.

However, automatic cervical dysplasia diagnosis via visual\ninspection, which is more appropriate in low-resource settings, remains a\nchallenging problem. Though promising results have been obtained by recent deep\nlearning models, their performance is significantly hindered by the limited\nscale of the available cervix datasets. Distinct from previous methods that\nlearn from a single dataset, we propose to leverage cross-domain cervical\nimages that were collected in different but related clinical studies to improve\nthe model's performance on the targeted cervix dataset. To robustly learn the\ntransferable information across datasets, we propose a novel prototype-based\nknowledge filtering method to estimate the transferability of cross-domain\nsamples. We further optimize the shared feature space by aligning the\ncross-domain image representations simultaneously on domain level with early\nalignment and class level with supervised contrastive learning, which endows\nmodel training and knowledge transfer with stronger robustness. The empirical\nresults on three real-world benchmark cervical image datasets show that our\nproposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art cervical dysplasia visual\ninspection by an absolute improvement of 4.7% in top-1 accuracy, 7.0% in\nprecision, 1.4% in recall, 4.6% in F1 score, and 0.05 in ROC-AUC.\n",

Radiotherapy is one\nof the main therapy methods but with high risk of acute hematologic toxicity.\nDelineating the bone marrow (BM) for sparing using computer tomography (CT)\nimages to plan before radiotherapy can effectively avoid this risk. Comparing\nwith magnetic resonance (MR) images, CT lacks the ability to express the\nactivity of BM. Thus, in current clinical practice, medical practitioners\nmanually delineate the BM on CT images by corresponding to MR images.

    "summary": "  Cytology screening from Papanicolaou (Pap) smears is a common and effective\ntool for the preventive clinical management of cervical cancer, where abnormal\ncell detection from whole slide images serves as the foundation for reporting\ncervical cytology. However, cervical cell detection remains challenging due to\n1) hazily-defined cell types (e.g., ASC-US) with subtle morphological\ndiscrepancies caused by the dynamic cancerization process, i.e., cell class\nambiguity, and 2) imbalanced class distributions of clinical data may cause\nmissed detection, especially for minor categories, i.e., cell class imbalance.\nTo this end, we propose a holistic and historical instance comparison approach\nfor cervical cell detection. Specifically, we first develop a holistic instance\ncomparison scheme enforcing both RoI-level and class-level cell discrimination.\nThis coarse-to-fine cell comparison encourages the model to learn\nforeground-distinguishable and class-wise representations. To emphatically\nimprove the distinguishability of minor classes, we then introduce a historical\ninstance comparison scheme with a confident sample selection-based memory bank,\nwhich involves comparing current embeddings with historical embeddings for\nbetter cell instance discrimination. Extensive experiments and analysis on two\nlarge-scale cytology datasets including 42,592 and 114,513 cervical cells\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

    "summary": "  Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide. The\navailability of a robust automated cervical image classification system can\naugment the clinical care provider's limitation in traditional visual\ninspection with acetic acid (VIA). However, there are a wide variety of\ncervical inspection objectives which impact the labeling criteria for\ncriteria-specific prediction model development. Moreover, due to the lack of\nconfirmatory test results and inter-rater labeling variation, many images are\nleft unlabeled.\n  Motivated by these challenges, we propose a self-supervised learning (SSL)\nbased approach to produce a pre-trained cervix model from unlabeled cervical\nimages. The developed model is further fine-tuned to produce criteria-specific\nclassification models with the available labeled images. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach using two cervical image datasets. Both\ndatasets are partially labeled and labeling criteria are different. The\nexperimental results show that the SSL-based initialization improves\nclassification performance (Accuracy: 2.5% min) and the inclusion of images\nfrom both datasets during SSL further improves the performance (Accuracy: 1.5%\nmin). Further, considering data-sharing restrictions, we experimented with the\neffectiveness of Federated SSL and find that it can improve performance over\nthe SSL model developed with just its images. This justifies the importance of\nSSL-based cervix model development. We believe that the present research shows\na novel direction in developing criteria-specific custom deep models for\ncervical image classification by combining images from different sources\nunlabeled and/or labeled with varying criteria, and addressing image access\nrestrictions.\n",

Recently there is a great interest to use the\noptical polarimetry as a non-invasive diagnosis tool to characterize the\ncervical tissues. In this context, it is crucial to validate the performance of\nvarious Mueller matrix decomposition techniques, that are utilized to extract\nthe intrinsic polarization properties of complex turbid media, such as\nbiological tissues. The aim of the work is to quantitatively compare the\nperformance of polar and differential MM decomposition methods for probing the\npolarization properties in various complex optical media. Complete polarization\nresponses of the cervical tissue sections, and other media are recorded by\npreparing a home-built Mueller matrix imaging set up with a spatial resolution\nof 400 nm. The Mueller matrices are then processed with the polar and\ndifferential decomposition methods to separate, and quantify the individual\npolarization parameters. ronounced differences in the extracted polarization\nproperties are observed for different CIN grades with both the decomposition\nmethods. Our results indicate that the differential decomposition of MM have\ncertain advantages over the polar decomposition method to extract the intrinsic\npolarization properties of a complex tissue medium. The quantified polarization\nparameters obtained through the decomposition methods can be used as useful\nmetrics to distinguish between the different grades of CIN, and to describe the\nhealing efficiency of a self-healing organic crystal. Thus the Mueller matrix\npolarimetry shows great potential as an label-free, non-invasive diagnostic and\nimaging tool with potential applications in biomedical clinical research, and\nin various other disciplines.\n",

In\nthe binary classification task (low-risk [normal, ectropion and LSIL] vs.\nhigh-risk [HSIL and cancer]), the CADx method achieved an area-under-the-curve\n(AUC) value of 0.959 with an 86.7 plus or minus 11.4% sensitivity and 93.5 plus\nor minus 3.8% specificity. Conclusion: The proposed deep-learning based CADx\nmethod outperformed three human experts. It was also able to identify\nmorphological characteristics in OCM images that were consistent with\nhistopathological interpretations. Significance: Label-free OCM imaging,\ncombined with deep-learning based CADx methods, hold a great promise to be used\nin clinical settings for the effective screening and diagnosis of cervical\ndiseases.\n",

    "summary": "  Automatic examination of thin-prep cytologic test (TCT) slides can assist\npathologists in finding cervical abnormality for accurate and efficient cancer\nscreening. Current solutions mostly need to localize suspicious cells and\nclassify abnormality based on local patches, concerning the fact that whole\nslide images of TCT are extremely large. It thus requires many annotations of\nnormal and abnormal cervical cells, to supervise the training of the\npatch-level classifier for promising performance. In this paper, we propose\nCellGAN to synthesize cytopathological images of various cervical cell types\nfor augmenting patch-level cell classification. Built upon a lightweight\nbackbone, CellGAN is equipped with a non-linear class mapping network to\neffectively incorporate cell type information into image generation. We also\npropose the Skip-layer Global Context module to model the complex spatial\nrelationship of the cells, and attain high fidelity of the synthesized images\nthrough adversarial learning. Our experiments demonstrate that CellGAN can\nproduce visually plausible TCT cytopathological images for different cell\ntypes. We also validate the effectiveness of using CellGAN to greatly augment\npatch-level cell classification performance.\n",

    "summary": "  Cervical cancer is one of the deadliest cancers affecting women globally.\nCervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) assessment using histopathological\nexamination of cervical biopsy slides is subject to interobserver variability.\nAutomated processing of digitized histopathology slides has the potential for\nmore accurate classification for CIN grades from normal to increasing grades of\npre-malignancy: CIN1, CIN2 and CIN3. Cervix disease is generally understood to\nprogress from the bottom (basement membrane) to the top of the epithelium. To\nmodel this relationship of disease severity to spatial distribution of\nabnormalities, we propose a network pipeline, DeepCIN, to analyze\nhigh-resolution epithelium images (manually extracted from whole-slide images)\nhierarchically by focusing on localized vertical regions and fusing this local\ninformation for determining Normal/CIN classification. The pipeline contains\ntwo classifier networks: 1) a cross-sectional, vertical segment-level sequence\ngenerator (two-stage encoder model) is trained using weak supervision to\ngenerate feature sequences from the vertical segments to preserve the\nbottom-to-top feature relationships in the epithelium image data; 2) an\nattention-based fusion network image-level classifier predicting the final CIN\ngrade by merging vertical segment sequences. The model produces the CIN\nclassification results and also determines the vertical segment contributions\nto CIN grade prediction. Experiments show that DeepCIN achieves\npathologist-level CIN classification accuracy.\n",

    "summary": "  This work presents an RL-based agent for outpatient hysteroscopy training.\nHysteroscopy is a gynecological procedure for examination of the uterine\ncavity. Recent advancements enabled performing this type of intervention in the\noutpatient setup without anaesthesia. While being beneficial to the patient,\nthis approach introduces new challenges for clinicians, who should take\nadditional measures to maintain the level of patient comfort and prevent tissue\ndamage. Our prior work has presented a platform for hysteroscopic training with\nthe focus on the passage of the cervical canal. With this work, we aim to\nextend the functionality of the platform by designing a subsystem that\nautonomously performs the task of the passage of the cervical canal. This\nfeature can later be used as a virtual instructor to provide educational cues\nfor trainees and assess their performance. The developed algorithm is based on\nthe soft actor critic approach to smooth the learning curve of the agent and\nensure uniform exploration of the workspace. The designed algorithm was tested\nagainst the performance of five clinicians. Overall, the algorithm demonstrated\nhigh efficiency and reliability, succeeding in 98% of trials and outperforming\nthe expert group in three out of four measured metrics.\n",

Hierarchical models are presented\nto investigate the properties of lymphatic vessel production in 2997 fields\ntaken from 20 individuals with invasive carcinoma, 21 individuals with cervical\nintraepithelial neoplasia and 21 controls. Such data demonstrate a high degree\nof correlation within tumour samples from the same individual. Joint\nhierarchical models utilising shared random effects are discussed and fitted in\na Bayesian framework to allow for the correlation between two key outcome\nmeasures: a random cluster size (the number of lymphatic vessels in a tissue\nsample) and a continuous outcome (vessel size). Results show that invasive\ncarcinoma samples are associated with increased production of smaller and more\nirregularly-shaped lymphatic vessels and suggest a mechanistic link between\ncarcinoma of the cervix and lymphangiogenesis.\n",

Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) appears to be a potential solution to this problem, as it has\nproven to provide equal or even better diagnoses than healthcare professionals.\nThis project aims to address the issue by collecting state-of-the-art\ntechniques for image classification from various fields and implementing them.\nSome of these techniques include mixup, presizing, and test-time augmentation,\namong others. Three architectures were used for the implementation:\nDenseNet121, VGG16 with batch normalization, and ResNet50. The models were\ndesigned with two main purposes. First, to classify images into seven\ncategories, including melanocytic nevus, melanoma, benign keratosis-like\nlesions, basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma,\nvascular lesions, and dermatofibroma. Second, to classify images into benign or\nmalignant. The models were trained using a dataset of 8012 images, and their\nperformance was evaluated using 2003 images. It's worth noting that this model\nis trained end-to-end, directly from the image to the labels, without the need\nfor handcrafted feature extraction.\n",
